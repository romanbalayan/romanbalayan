I am Roman Lorenzo Balayan, from Manila, Philippines. I am currently a Lead Software Engineer at PayMaya Philippines, Inc.

I love solving problems and building creative solutions. Currently, I'm focused on working with software architecture and design, and building secure and scalable products on the cloud.  I am also interested in DevOps and Automation tools, while looking to continuously improve on existing processes. Outside of my jobby job, I try to give back to the community by contributing to open-source projects.
 
On my down time, I like watching videos on Twitch and YouTube, listening to music on Spotify, or listening to podcasts on Overcast.
